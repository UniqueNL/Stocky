# Stocky
Made to save the world. Well.. actually to learn more about Ruby on Rails. We were challenged by Codaisseur to make a Rails application, which is a huge challenge because we were all beginners. Our first real application running on Rails. To make it even a bigger challenge, all teams (seven in total) we're fighting for the first place. And guess what...? We got 'em. 

Stocky is made to organize your ingredients at your place and see the expiration date. This means you can check out which products you have to use, because otherwise you have to throw them away.. and we don't want to waste food. We want to save the world! It all includes:

* Adding new ingredients
* Adding categories
* Adding locations
* Search for recipes
* Edit ingredients, locations and categories
* Check the expiration dates
* Check the almost expiration dates
And more secret stuff we wanted to include.. but we ran out of time.
